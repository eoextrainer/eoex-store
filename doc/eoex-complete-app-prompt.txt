as a senior mobile, web software developer and release manager

objective: Generate a complete, production-ready web and hybrid mobile/web application for the EOEX App Store (or a user-specified app name), including
backend, frontend, database, Dockerization, and DevOps workflows, using the following requirements and detailed step-by-step implementation.

create a workflow that
    prompts for the software project folder location,
    changes the current directory to this folder,
    Prompt: Please provide the name of the app to be created
    checks if this directory has a git repo.
        if not then initialise this local repo.
    create a readme file with the message "Hello from EOEX. this is [app name] application.".
    create in this directory the python virtual environment venv.
    save the vscode workspace.
    create the following branches [change master to main, develop, feature, fix, test, ready, archive, int, qa, prod].
    ask the user for the target remote repo location.
    create a first commit and push and the changes and the branches to the remote repo using the appropriate message.
    then create a workflow in the form of a bash script called [app-name]-saves.sh that will automatically after every major changes to the application: save, stash, stage, commit + message, push, pull request and merge request the latest changes.
    dockerise the entire project folder.



in order to reuse this entire procedure create a an artificial intelligence prompt in markdown format to reproduce the entire setup process.

application development workflow

delivers a complete, production-ready scaffold for a Netflix-style mobile UI in React Native. It includes dark UI branding, a cinematic splash, cross-fade transitions, staggered section reveals with slide and zoom, secure auth storage, deep linking to YouTube, an inline WebView player, theme context with persistence and manual toggle, navigation, and performance optimizations.

Project Structure:
- `/frontend` (React Native for hybrid mobile/web, Netflix-style UI, see below)
- `/backend` (Python FastAPI)
- `/database` (MySQL, user table with admin/user roles)
- Dockerized for all services
- Git with custom workflow and branch structure

Initialize Project Structure
    Create the following folders: /frontend, /backend, /database, /docs, /scripts
    Initialize a Git repository and set up the required branch structure
    Add .gitignore files as needed
    Run: ./scripts/app-changes.sh "Initialize project structure"

 Frontend:
- Use the provided React Native Netflix-style UI template (see `eoex-app-frontend-template.txt`)
- Splash screen, home screen, carousels, secure auth, deep linking, theme context, and all features as described
- Must run as a web app (Chrome) and as a mobile app (Android emulator)
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native (with web support via `react-native-web`)

    the application will be a web application
    the application will use only the following tech stack:
        htmls, css, javascript on the frontent + related frameworks and dependencies
        mysql database + related frameworks and dependencies
        python + related frameworks and dependencies
        docker + compose + dockerhub [https://hub.docker.com/repositories/eoex] - create a repository and push the app to the docker hub repo
    the application architecture will contain:
        - frontend
            splash screen
                black background
                white baseline at the center of the screen
                the EOEX brand name (in bold red netflix colours) reveals itself slowly from beneath the baseline until it rises a few pixels above the base line, then vibrates horizontally for 7 seconds
                the App name appears a few pixels below the baseline in a smooth fashion
                the entire spalsh screen closes in on itself like an old television set turning off
                then the home screen appears
                go to the project doc/ folder
                locate the eoex-app-splashscreen-1.txt file
                use it for the design of the splashscreen

            build the app frontend splashscreen and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages

            home screen
                the home screen uses the same design, layout, colour palette and fonts as the https://www.netflix.com website
                the home screen uses the following design patterns found in the file: eoex-app-frontend-template.txt - this file is located inside the project folder docs/ folder
                page header [10% of the screen height]:
                    contains the app name and logo in the top left corner
                    contains the [sign in | login] options in the top right corner
                section 1: hero caroussel
                    here we see a medium size horizontal video caroussel using 5 video urls from the file [eoex-app-frontend-template.txt]
                    the caroussel shows only one video at a time and after 2 seconds it toggles cycically to the next
                section 2: netflix style horizontal video tile grid (1x6) per product family
                    product families:
                        - health & fitness
                        - personal finances
                        - productivity
                        - travel & hospitality
                        - entertainments
                        - shopping
                go to the project doc/ folder
                locate the eoex-app-build-1.txt file
                use it for the design of the home screen

            build the app frontend home screen and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages

        - backend

        build the complete app backend scaffolding and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages

        - (future) API integrations

        build the complete app api integration scaffolding and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages

        - authentication (using google accounts)

        build the complete app authentication scaffolding and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages

        - database
            the database data model must contain tables for:
                users (save their google credentials), and create on platform admin user
                apps (represented by tiles in the home screen) [name, vendor, version, target platform, downloads, size, host source, revisions, bugs, etc..]
                store (users of this platform, downloads)
                other tables will be added

        build the complete app database scaffolding and run the [app-name]-saves.sh script to save and push the changes uing the relevant commit messages



in order to reuse this entire procedure create a an artificial intelligence prompt in markdown format to reproduce the entire application development workflow process.


 Instructions for AI
Prompt the user for the app name and use it throughout the project.
Generate all code, configuration, and documentation files required for a full-stack EOEX App Store (or user-specified app) as described
above.
Use the provided frontend template for all UI/UX and component structure.
Ensure all Docker, backend, and database files are compatible and ready to run.
Implement the Git workflow and automation script as described.
At each major implementation stage, execute app-changes.sh to commit and document progress.
Output the project as a ready-to-run monorepo.
