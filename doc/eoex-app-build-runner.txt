use the doc folder to implement the instructions in the file [eoex-complete-app-prompt.txt]. if the process stalls or is interrupted then save the status of the implementation stage and resume from there

the main steps to implement are:

Prompt for the app name and project folder location.
Initialize git, create README, venv, VSCode workspace, and branches.
Prompt for remote repo, push initial commit and branches.
Create the workflow automation script ([app-name]-saves.sh).
Create the project structure: /frontend, /backend, /database, /docs, /scripts.
Scaffold the frontend (React Native web/mobile, Netflix-style UI).
Scaffold the backend (FastAPI, MySQL).
Scaffold the database (schema, seed data).
Dockerize all services.
Document setup and workflow.
Test and finalize implementation.
Generate a reusable AI prompt for the workflow.
