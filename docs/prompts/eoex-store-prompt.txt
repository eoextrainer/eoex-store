        - username: Sosthene Grosset-Janin
        - user email: educ1.eoex@gmail.com
        - create a first commit with message "FIRST COMMIT: [eoex-app-name - app setup-SGJ -v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]"
        - use this commit structure for every commit
        - the source remote repo (where the first project source is downloaded from) is: git@github.com:eoextrainer/eoex-store.git
        - the downstream remote repo is: git@github.com:eoextrainer/eoex-store.git
        - the upstream remote repo is: git@github.com:eoextrainer/eoex-store.git
        - create the following local git branches:
            change master to main -> synched to the downstream remote repo main branch
            develop
            feature
            fix
            test
            ready -> synched to the downstream remote repo int branch
            archive
        - every time some new development is required you must follow this workflow:
            pull sources from the downstream remote repo into the local main branch
            update the local develop branch with these sources
            update the local feature branch with these sources
            create a new feature branch from the "feature" branch with name: feat-[name-of-new-feature]
            save all of the local developments
            stash all of the changes with the relevant message and tag
            stage all of the changes
            commit all of the changes with the relevant message in the format:[eoex-ai-travel-agent-[short description of the changes]-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local test branch
            thoroughly test all aspects of the application in its current state: backend, integrations, database, front end, ports
            open the application fronend from the local chrome browser with no cache
            if any of the tests fail then stop and request input from the developer
            if all of the tests are successful and the application successfully loads in the browser then continue
            create a patch and bundle of all of the changes inside the archive branch and commit them with a message of the format: [eoex-ai-travel-agent-app project archive-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local readt branch
            push all of the changes from the local ready branch onto the remote repo int branch
            create a pull and merge request
        - every time a feature enhancement is required you must follow this workflow:
            pull sources from the downstream remote repo into the local main branch
            update the local develop branch with these sources
            update the local feature branch with these sources
            checkout to the target feature branch
            save all of the local developments
            stash all of the changes with the relevant message and tag
            stage all of the changes
            commit all of the changes with the relevant message in the format:[eoex-ai-travel-agent-[short description of the changes]-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local test branch
            thoroughly test all aspects of the application in its current state: backend, integrations, database, front end, ports
            open the application fronend from the local chrome browser with no cache
            if any of the tests fail then stop and request input from the developer
            if all of the tests are successful and the application successfully loads in the browser then continue
            create a patch and bundle of all of the changes inside the archive branch and commit them with a message of the format: [eoex-ai-travel-agent-app project archive-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local readt branch
            push all of the changes from the local ready branch onto the remote repo int branch
            create a pull and merge request
        - every time a bug fix is required you must follow this workflow:
            pull sources from the downstream remote repo into the local main branch
            update the local develop branch with these sources
            update the local fix branch with these sources
            create a new bugfix branch from the "fix" branch with name: bugfix-[bug-to-fix]
            save all of the local developments
            stash all of the changes with the relevant message and tag
            stage all of the changes
            commit all of the changes with the relevant message in the format:[eoex-ai-travel-agent-[short description of the changes]-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local test branch
            thoroughly test all aspects of the application in its current state: backend, integrations, database, front end, ports
            open the application fronend from the local chrome browser with no cache
            if any of the tests fail then stop and request input from the developer
            if all of the tests are successful and the application successfully loads in the browser then continue
            create a patch and bundle of all of the changes inside the archive branch and commit them with a message of the format: [eoex-ai-travel-agent-app project archive-SGJ-v[incremental major version number].[incremental minor version number].[incrementatl patch number]]
            checkout and merge changes to the local readt branch
            push all of the changes from the local ready branch onto the remote repo int branch
            create a pull and merge request
        - save these three workflows inside a file called: app-changes.sh bash script.
        - this script when run will ask the user what action to take (new development / feature enhancement / bug fix) and based on the user input the script will execute the correct workflow completely.
    8- dockerise the entire application
    9- create the application scaffolding with the following structure:
        - frontend
            - spalsh screen
            - home screen
        - backend
        - database
    10- add the following folders to the project workspace:
        -/media/eoex/DOJO/CONSULTING/PROJECTS/
    11- use the contents of the following file to build the complete frontend: /media/eoex/DOJO/CONSULTING/PROJECTS/templates/prompts/eoex-app-frontend-template.txt
